üè° House Price Prediction App

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts house prices based on key features like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, garage size, year built, and neighborhood quality.

The workflow includes:

Dataset: A CSV file containing housing data.

Model: A linear regression model trained to estimate house prices.

App: A Streamlit interface (app.py) that allows users to enter house details and instantly get a price prediction.

Features

Clean and interactive web app using Streamlit

User-friendly sidebar inputs for house attributes

Real-time prediction powered by the trained model (model.pkl)

Easy to extend with more features or different ML models
